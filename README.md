# AddmissionParser

Simple parser for documents, that described admission process of the 2017 year (in another year - documents may differ)
It parses documents from three Niznhy Novrogord unversities:
* High school of economics
* Lobachevsky unversity
* Linguistic University

As result - it produces html file with current position of enrollee in concurs.
Enrollee name must be changed in MainClass file, also - in UNNParser download link must be modified.
